# Lab12 Java

This repository contains 2 projects: 
- compulsory + optional + bonus for lab 11.
- the project for bonus part which contains an AmazingButton (I integrated this in the first project with the jar I exported)
The repository also contains screenShot to see the GUI application + the xml representation of designPanel

I can't entirely separate Compulsory and Optional parts (javadoc will be helpful with this problem)

## Compulsory
You can write a JComponent class in the first field and click on the canvas in order to draw a JComponent in that position. As you can see I created a login form just with this tool.

## Optional 

Now, we can see properties in the JTable for a JComponent by clicking on it. Also, we can save and load designPanel (the canvas) with XML export and import.

##Bonus

Including the jar from the other project, now we can write in the Class field com.bonus.AmazingButton and add AmazingButtons to out canvas.
I also added some annotations to check the task. I prefer use already defined annotations.
